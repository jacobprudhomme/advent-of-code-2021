# Advent of Code 2021
This year, for my second Advent of Code, I have decided to use Rust in order to help learn the language.

# Execution Environment
For all the problems, I used `rustc` `1.56.1` and `cargo` `1.56.0`, installed using `rustup`.

# How to Use
First, all solutions must be built, using `cargo build`.

All solutions expect input on `stdin`. Call them like so: `cargo run -q --bin dayX-partY < inputs/dayX > output` to obtain the output in a file.
